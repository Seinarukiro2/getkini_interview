# Candidate Data Parser

Welcome to Candidate Data Parser! This application is designed to assist in parsing candidate emails to extract key data and information from their resumes. The core functionality is implemented in Python using the Telethon library for Telegram integration.

## How to Run

To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. Install all dependencies by running the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the application using the following command:
`python3 main.py`

3. All resumes are stored in the `data` folder in the `.eml` format.

## Goals

My primary goal is to implement artificial intelligence for automated resume parsing and data extraction using the Chat-GPT-3.5-Turbo model. Additionally, we aim to deploy an isolated model on a personal server for commercial use.
